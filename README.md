PowerShell script for removing HP bloatware and blocking telemetry on HP laptops while protecting critical hardware functionality.

## Overview

Hardware-aware debloater that safely removes HP bloatware (Support Assistant, telemetry, analytics) while protecting essential laptop hardware services (audio, touchpad, display, power management, keyboard).

## Critical Exclusions

This script **INTENTIONALLY DOES NOT TOUCH**:
- ‚ùå BIOS/UEFI configuration services (can brick system)
- ‚ùå MUX switch / GPU multiplexer services (hardware routing)
- ‚ùå Firmware update services (security critical)
- ‚ùå TPM/Security chip services (system lockout risk)
- ‚ùå Hardware management engines (Intel ME, AMD PSP)

## Protected Hardware Services

**NEVER Disabled** (Essential Functionality):
- üîí Audio services (speakers, headphones)
- üîí Touchpad services (trackpad control)
- üîí Display control (brightness adjustment)
- üîí Power management (battery optimization)
- üîí WMI service (hardware communication)
- üîí Hotkey service (function keys)
- üîí Wireless button (WiFi/Bluetooth toggle)

## Features

- **Safe Bloatware Removal**: Targets only non-essential HP software
- **Network Isolation**: Blocks 21 HP telemetry domains (hosts + firewall)
- **Hardware Protection**: Critical services cannot be disabled
- **Comprehensive Backup**: Services, tasks, firewall rules, hosts file
- **Full Rollback**: Complete system state restoration
- **Multi-Stage Consent**: 5-page disclaimer + explicit confirmations
- **OMEN Support**: Enable/disable OMEN Gaming Hub (MUX protected)

## Target Services

### Bloatware (Safe to Remove)
- HP Support Assistant
- HP Telemetry & Analytics
- HP Customer Participation Program
- HP Diagnostics
- HP JumpStart Bridge
- HP Documentation

### Network Blocking
- `telemetry.hp.com`, `metrics.hp.com`, `analytics.hp.com`
- `tracking.hp.com`, `ceip.hp.com`, `feedback.hp.com`
- HP crash reporting and diagnostics domains
- OMEN-specific telemetry domains

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- **Administrator privileges required**
- **Windows 10/11**
- **HP Laptop** (optimized for OMEN series)
- **Create System Restore Point** (mandatory recommendation)

### Installation

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**

2. **Navigate to script directory**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\path\to\HPDebloater
   ```

3. **Set execution policy** (current session only)
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
   ```

4. **Run the script**
   ```powershell
   .\HPDebloater.ps1
   ```

### Operation Modes

```
[1] OMEN GAMING HUB - ENABLE
    Enable OMEN services temporarily (for settings access)

[2] OMEN GAMING HUB - DISABLE
    Disable OMEN bloatware (MUX switch remains protected)

[3] GENERAL HP DEBLOAT
    Remove HP bloatware and telemetry (safe mode)

[4] NETWORK ISOLATION
    Block HP telemetry domains and analytics services

[5] ROLLBACK MODE
    Restore system from backup

[R] QUICK RECOVERY
    Emergency restore of all hardware services

[Q] QUIT
```

## Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Multi-Layer Protection
- Critical service whitelist (auto-blocked from disable)
- Semi-critical warnings (two-stage consent required)
- Explicit consent phrases for dangerous operations

### 2. Backup System
```
HPDebloater_Backups/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup_manifest.json        # Metadata
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services_backup.json        # Service states
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task_*.xml                  # Scheduled tasks (XML export)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hosts_backup.txt            # Hosts file
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ firewall_rules_backup.json  # Firewall rules
```

### 3. Disclaimer System
- 5-page comprehensive disclaimer
- Warranty void warnings
- Hardware impact explanations
- Required consent: `"I HAVE READ ALL 5 PAGES AND ACCEPT ALL RISKS"`

### 4. Recovery Options
- **Quick Recovery**: One-click hardware service restoration
- **Full Rollback**: Complete system state restore from backup
- **Manual Recovery**: Step-by-step instructions provided
- **System Restore Point**: Windows-native recovery (user-created)

## Technical Details

### Blocking Methodology

1. **Service Management**: Disable bloatware services via `Set-Service`
2. **Scheduled Tasks**: Disable HP tasks via `Disable-ScheduledTask`
3. **Hosts File**: Redirect telemetry domains to `0.0.0.0`
4. **Firewall Rules**: Program-based blocking (inbound + outbound)

### File Locations

- Logs: `HPDebloater_Logs\HPDebloater_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- Backups: `HPDebloater_Backups\Backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS\`
- Transcript: `HPDebloater_Logs\HPDebloater_Transcript_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`

## Warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARRANTY IMPLICATIONS
- **HP warranty MAY BE VOIDED** by modifying system services
- HP Support may refuse assistance on modified systems
- HP may flag system as "modified" and deny service

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HARDWARE RISKS
If you accidentally disable wrong services:
- Touchpad may stop working (external mouse required)
- Speakers/headphones may produce no sound
- Brightness control may fail
- Battery optimization may be lost
- Function keys (Fn) may not work

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SYSTEM STABILITY
- Always create Windows System Restore Point first
- Test in non-production environment if possible
- Understand implications before proceeding
- Keep external mouse/keyboard available

## Recovery Procedures
